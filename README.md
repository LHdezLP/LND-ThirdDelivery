# HTML, CSS and Javascript Project for begginers

This project's main purpose is to help us students to get comfortable with HTML, CSS and javascript by learning by the means of practice.

## Description

In this little practice project I'm aiming to emulate the format of a travel web page. Focused specifically on advertising Gran Canaria, it is intended for the page to give to registered users the tools to book a trip to the island, as well as offering some info about the places of interest and wonders Gran Canaria.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* It makes use of icons from the FontAwesome library "https://kit.fontawesome.com/eed3c59194.js"
* It also makes use of Bootstraps 5
### Installing

* This project is meant for school marking and can be accessed from GitHub by the professor's request.

### Executing program

* This project is an HTML web page designed to be responsive.

For the 'tablet' and 'cell phone' versions, the user menu within the header remains hidden until activated by clicking the 'user' icon. This menu can be toggled to hide again by clicking the icon once more.

In the "Descubrela" section, accessible by scrolling down or clicking the "Explore" button, a scroll effect unfolds. It gradually reveals brief descriptions of the Island's wonders as users scroll through the section.

Both the footer and the navbar are responsive, tailored to display optimally across three different screen sizes. Clicking the "Booking" button in the header redirects users to a page where they can plan their vacations on the Island and leave reviews if they wish. This menu was developed using Bootstrap 5 and CSS, with its functionality and validation managed through JavaScript.

### 16/11/2023 COMMIT CHANGES NEW++ SECOND DELIVERY

With this new commit, part of the second of three deliveries of this HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project for my school assignment, I aimed to address some issues from the previous version of the project. Additionally, I aimed to fulfill the requirements of the second delivery, which involved practicing with the Bootstrap framework, JavaScript validation, and utilizing forms.

I must admit, the result ended up being far less polished than I intended. I followed an idea and stuck with it until the end, only to realize that perhaps my skills at the moment and my understanding of Bootstrap weren't sufficient to fully realize my ambitions.

This ongoing page allows users to explore some aspects of the natural treasures of Gran Canaria. They can also share reviews while reading comments and appreciations left by others.

The form used has been validated to make some fields mandatory and to set a maximum length for each of them. 

### 07/12/2023 COMMIT CHANGES NEW++ THIRD DELIVERY

In this final delivery, some of the previous challenges and problems have been solved. Scroll animations have been added, enhancing the overall appearance and functionality of the page. This revamp and improvement hopefully showcase the progress made this trimester, while also leaving the door open for further enhancements.
